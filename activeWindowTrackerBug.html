<a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/santhosh/20050702#find_current_last_active_window">
Find Current/Last Active Window</a> returns wrong window in a special scenario. 
The scenario is as follows:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us say the application's main window is 
  called MainFrame. When the application is launched MainFrame is shown and 
  KeyboardFocusManager fires a property change for &quot;activeWindow&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">The ActiveWindowTracker which is registered 
  to KeyboardFocusManager gets the event and updates the variable activeWindow 
  to MainFrame.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us say user performs a action which 
  results in displaying a ProgressDialog.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">When the ProgressDialog shows up, 
  ActiveWindowTracker receives property change event from KeyboardFocusManager 
  and updates the variable to activeWindow to ProgressDialog.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us say, you switched to some other 
  application. Then ActiveWindowTracker receives a property change event saying 
  that currentActiveWindow is null. But ActiveWindowTracker does nothing on this 
  event.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us assume that, While you are in some 
  other application, the progress dialog is closed, then ActiveWindowTracker 
  receives a windowClosingEvent and makes the variable activeWindow to null. 
  (NOTE: KeyboardFocusManager doesn't fire any event for this, because still 
  there is no active window).</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us say, after ProgressDialog gets 
  closed, another dialog say StausDialog shows up saying that the task is 
  completed.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now if StatusDialog asks ActiveWindowTracker 
  for current active window (to set owner window), it returns the shared frame 
  instance rather than MainFrame. This is the BUG.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This bug can be fixed, by changing the 
ActiveWindowTracker to store stack of last active windows rather than just one.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I hope my explanation is understandable to you.</font></p>
