<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I daily visit many swing blogs. But I am not 
impressed by most of them. Most of them discuss about swings tricks to do some 
jazzy tasks. <b>JAZZY</b> , I mean tricks which are not quite useful in normal daily 
programming. This resulted the birth of this blog. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In this blog, I am/will concentrate only such 
topics, which will be useful by any swing developer in his daily programming. I 
would like to hear your comments (either +ve or -ve), any new ideas, suggestions 
you have. <b>&quot;Visual Clues for JList DND&quot; </b>is actually in response to a 
developer's request. This will help in keeping this blog alive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I have 5 years experience in Swing. I have 
never seen such a flexible GUI Framework anywhere. The flexibility that Swing 
gives to us enormous. You can mould it in whatever way you want. You can create 
applications as ugly as possible and as beautiful as possible. It is in 
developers' hands.</font></p>
