  <title>Intellij Idea key scheme for Eclipse</title>

I joined&nbsp;<a href="http://sonoasystems.com/">http://sonoasystems.com/</a>
and working on eclipse plugin development. I had to switch to eclipse
from Intellij Idea, to take advantage of eclipse PDE support. I didn't
find any key scheme of intellij idea distributed with eclipse. So I
created one myself. If anybody interested, you can download it here:<br>

<br>

<a href="http://jroller.com/santhosh/resource/IdeaKeyScheme.jar">sources</a>
and <a href="http://jroller.com/santhosh/resource/IdeaKeyScheme_1.0.0.jar">plugin</a><br>

<br>

Drop the plugin jar in eclipse/plugins folder and restart eclipse. Now
in preferences dialog under General &gt; Keys you can find
"Intellij Idea" key scheme.<br>

Hope this will be useful to idea fans who has to get their hands dirty
with eclipse ;)
