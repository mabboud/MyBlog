When developers tries to convert a file which contains special characters like spaces or exclamation mark in their filepath to url, they face some problems.

Here is sample snippet which tries to convert file to url:
[code]
public class FileToURL{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
        File file = new File("C:\\Documents and Settings\\administrator\\Desktop\\xsl\\test.xsl");
        System.out.println("file.toURL() ----> "+file.toURL());
        System.out.println("file.toURI().toURL() ----> "+file.toURI().toURL());
    }
}
[/code]

when you run the program it prints the following output:

[code]
file.toURL() ----> file:/C:/Documents and Settings/administrator/Desktop/xsl/test.xsl
file.toURI().toURL() ----> file:/C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/administrator/Desktop/xsl/test.xsl
[/code]

<b>File.toURL()</b>:
   it just preppends "file:/" to the filepath. it doesn't try to escape any special characters in the filepath
   
<b>File.toURI().toURL()</b>:
   it gives correct output, escaping any special characters in the filepath.

there are actualy bugs for this in Sun's bugzilla.

<a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4273532">4273532</a>: toURL() method in File class needs to escape excluded URL characters
this bug is closed by saying <b>won't fix</b>. The reason it says is, it breaks backward compatibility and suggests to use URI class which was introduced in JDK 1.4

<a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6179468">6179468</a>: File.toURL should be @deprecated
this is fixed for mustang release (b39)

so, be careful when converting File to URL.

Enjoy!
