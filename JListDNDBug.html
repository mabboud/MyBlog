and Drop.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Most of our clients has reposted a problem 
that, when they drag an item in list and drop somewhere, sometimes an item above 
or below actually gets dropped rather than the actually dragged item in list. 
Then I tried to find why it is happening so. I found the reason for this, and it 
is always reproducible even in JDK1.5 </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>When does this actually happen ?</b><br>
<br>
Select an item say &quot;Item3&quot; in JList. Press the mouse Just above &quot;Item4&quot;. Then 
drag the mouse over &quot;Item4&quot; to another JList as shown by arrow in the above 
figure. When the mouse is over &quot;Item4&quot;, suddenly the selection switches to 
&quot;Item4&quot; and on drop, instead of &quot;Item3&quot; getting dropped, &quot;Item4&quot; gets dropped.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Why is it happening so?</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">JList changes its selection on mouse drag. the 
drag gesture threshold is 5 pixels in swing. Thus the mouse drag is actually 
recognized as drag-gesture after the mouse is dragged 5 pixels, If you have 
dragged the mouse along the patch shown in figure, after 5 pixels the mouse will 
be over &quot;Item4&quot;. As JList changes its selection on mouse drag, the selection is 
changed to &quot;Item4&quot;. and after the drag of 5 pixels, the mouse gesture is 
recognized as drag-gesture and drag-gesture-recognizer takes the current 
selection as transferable object which is &quot;Item4&quot; rather than &quot;Item3&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is happening of because of the use of hack 
that I mentioned in following post:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
If you don't apply this hack, it works fine. So we need to find better fix. 
please don't use the hack in above mentioned post.<br>
<br>
You can try to reproduce this using the 
following webstart demo.</font></p>
